       <h2><p style="text-align: justify;">
            Today, forests around the world are under assault. They are sick, they are burning and they are disappearing. Above all, our economic development has placed enormous pressure on the worldâ€™s forests. Nations often rely on natural resource extraction and agricultural expansion to meet ever-growing national and international demand. This provides people with livelihoods, infrastructure and social services. However, land development also leads to a loss of biodiversity, fertile soil and ecosystem services, which threatens the welfare of generations to come.

            Forests are important for animals and us. They give us food to eat. They give us many fruits and vegetables. We get honey from trees in forests. Big and small animals live in forests like lions, tigers and wolves. Forests also give us medicines. They bring rain. They keep the surroundings clean.

We should save forests and stop cutting the trees. Humans are cutting trees for tables, chairs and huts. We should plant more trees. They give us oxygen to breathe. No forests mean no greenery and no food. Forests are our best friends. They are also best friends of animals.

                Forests are home to various types of flora and fauna. They are vital for our survival. They maintain temperature and prevent our surroundings from excessive heat. However, these deep, dark woods not only help in sustaining the lives of animals and birds, but they are also equally important for the survival of humankind. They provide raw materials such as timber, fruits, wax, honey, vegetables, wood, leaves for medicines and bark for paper.

Besides being a rich source of raw materials for human needs, they are a great source of maintaining wildlife. Trees prevent soil erosion- degradation of soil due to the removal of its upper layer. Not only this, but they also keep streams flowing and air pure that helps in providing us fresh oxygen and a clean environment.

        <h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Forests are blessings for humankind as well as animals and birds. Earth is the only planet to inhabit such a diverse variety of the same all across the globe. They prove beneficial to the human race for umpteen reasons being medicines, food, shelter, industries, furniture, certain utensils, papers, wax and several beauty products.

However, excessive dependence on forests and rapid deforestation has left the trees only in scanty. Scorching heat, rising temperatures, drying up of rivers and streams, impure air, increase in carbon dioxide are the causes of deforestation and human recklessness.

                Recent burning of some of the greatest forests such as Amazon jungles has added to our plight. Australian bushfires are yet another example that killed mammoths of kangaroos and pandas among other animals. If the practice of deforestation persists, soon we will be devoid of plants and eventually life on earth. The day of the perdition of the earth is nearing. We must count on plants, and protect them to sustain life on earth for good.

Greta Thunberg, the famous and one of the youngest social activists did raise her concern over environmental degradation yet her voice seemed to fall on deaf ears. Nobody paid heed to the young lady, but the condition or our environment today invites an urgent need to draw our attention towards these plants, animals and forests.
