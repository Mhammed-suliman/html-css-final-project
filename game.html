                    I’m the type of guy that would go out and buy a Call of Duty game, pop it open and gather all my friends and jump right into it. Call of Duty is one of the most popular games out and many people love to play. It is competitive, it has online play, and you can also create a clan or group to play against other people around the world online. Call of Duty dates back to 2003 and really wasn’t popular then because it’s all about killing your enemy.

                Players can use their pickaxe to knock down existing structures on the map to collect basic resources that are wood, brick, and metal. Subsequently, in all modes, the player can use these materials to build fortifications, such as walls, floors, and stairs. Such fortification pieces can be edited to add things like windows or doors. The materials used have different durability properties and can be updated to stronger variants using more materials of the same type.

                    Every few minutes, the playable area of the map begins to shrink down towards a random location, with any player caught outside the safe area taking damage incrementally, and eventually being eliminated if the safe zone is not entered in time; in game, the players see the boundary as a shimmering blue wall that contracts over time.[4] This results in a more confined map, in turn increasing the chances of encounters.[1] During the course of the match, random regions of the map are highlighted in red and bombed, posing a threat to players who remain in that area.

                    To help the Crewmates identify Impostors, there are various surveillance systems on each map, such as security cameras system on The Skeld,[19] a doorlog in MIRA HQ,[20] and a vitals indicator in Polus.[10] Crewmates may also confirm their identity through visual tasks, which cannot be faked by Impostors.[21] Any living player may call a group meeting by reporting a dead body, or by pressing the Emergency Meeting button at any time (except during major sabotages, when Emergency Meetings cannot be called, but dead bodies can still be reported).[14][22][23]

                    The game has an inventory system, allowing players to carry a limited number of items.[45] Upon dying, items in the players' inventories are dropped unless the game is reconfigured not to do so. Players then re-spawn at their spawn point, which by default is where players first spawn in the game, and can be reset by sleeping in a bed[46] or using a respawn anchor.[47][48] Dropped items can be recovered if players can reach them before they disappear or despawn after 5 minutes. Players may acquire experience points by killing mobs and other players, mining, smelting ores, breeding animals, and cooking food. Experience can then be spent on enchanting tools, armor and weapons.

                    The graphics were described as having "a benefit for mid and low specification phones", but a reviewer stated that "if games with good graphics are your thing then we don't recommend that you play Free Fire Battlegrounds. But if you like battle royale games and want to have fun with your friends, you should definitely play."[11]

Tais Carvalho of TechTudo commented that Free Fire "prioritizes performance, making it a great choice for any type of device. The gameplay stands out and has enough content to entertain and offer rewarding combat." Regarding the progression of characters and skills, she said it is "a flashy add-on."[12]
